## 💡 Inspiration 💡

Howdy neigh-bor! When we were brainstorming for the hackathon theme, we got the idea to emulate the comfy vibes we’d get from retro video games such as Jackal and Contra 🤠🎮

## ⚙ What it does ⚙

It’s a retro-inspired video game where our character, a cowboy, is in the ~wild west~ helping to protect the peace of the land from enemies with a classic point-and-shoot game.

## 🏗 How we built it 🏗

We built it using Unity’s game engine and C#. We deployed the Unity program using WebGL and used the build files in ReactJS that helped us bring it to the web.
